# Restaurant-website

 I created a restaurant site clone using HTML and CSS. The idea was to replicate the user interface and design of a popular restaurant website. I focused on making it visually appealing with a responsive layout to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.  While it's a clone, I put effort into capturing the essence of the original site.
